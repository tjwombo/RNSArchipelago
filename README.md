# Rabbit and Steel Archipelago

Adds support for [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) to Rabbit and Steel. Currently a Work in Progress mod.

## APWorld

The APWorld can be found in the releases tab [here](https://github.com/tjwombo/RNSArchipelago/releases)

## Bug Reports

If you found any bugs, no you didn't.
But if you insist you did, please report it in the Archipelago discord server [here](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1241105661425877194)

## Installation

This mod uses [R2Reloaded](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) and can be installed by
1. Adding Rabbit and Steel as an application by clicking the + button
2. Download the mod by clicking the ⚙+ button
3. Search "RnS Reloaded" and install it

Alternatively, it can be downloaded manually by 
1. Downloading the .7z file in releases
2. Dragging it (while still zipped) onto the Reloaded 2 "Configure Mods" screen

This mod requires two dependencies, reloaded.sharedlib.hooks and RNSReloaded which should be installed automatically regardless of which instalation method you choose.

## Configuration

If you right click the mod in R2Reloaded, there is a Configure button.
That is mainly in charge of controlling the in game messages that mimica text client.
Sending commands to the server is not currently supported.

The other part of the configuration is the location to the archipelago cache, which should be set automatically, but if its not in AppData/Local you will need to set it
I believe I can remove this, but for now there is still some code that needs this.
