## Installation

**Note Reloaded-II is having trouble finding the updated version automatically, it is recommended to install manually for the time being**

This mod uses [R2Reloaded](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) and can be installed by
Adding Rabbit and Steel as an application by clicking the + button

And then
1. Download the mod by clicking the ⚙+ button
2. Filter All Sources to RabbitSteel.exe
3. Search "RnS Reloaded" and install it

Alternatively, it can be downloaded manually by 
1. Downloading the .7z file in releases
2. Dragging it (while still zipped) onto the Reloaded 2 "Configure Mods" screen, which is reached by clicking on the Rabbit and Steel Icon

Then on the "Configure Mods" screen make sure the mod is active, box should be red and have a + instead of -
- RNSReloaded should have a filled in red box
And then hit "Launch Application"

This mod requires two dependencies, reloaded.sharedlib.hooks and RNSReloaded (along with their dependencies) which should be installed automatically regardless of which instalation method you choose.

## Configuration

If you right click the mod in R2Reloaded, there is a Configure button.
That is mainly in charge of controlling the in game messages that mimic a text client.
Sending commands to the server is not currently supported.

The other part is for the location of Reloaded-II for the purposes of creating the item mods. You will need to set this if the automatically set Mods folder doesn't match.
The correct directory should be where Reloaded-II is installed + \Mods. For example, mine is C:\Reloaded-II\Mods
If setting this directory doesn't work, then turn on the Skip Item Creation config and you will need to manually install the items mod.
To do so, download the ArchipelagoItems.zip file in the releases tab and extract it into your Rabbit and Steel mods folder like so steamapps\common\Rabbit and Steel\mods\ArchipelagoItems
