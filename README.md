## Installation

This mod uses [R2Reloaded](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) and can be installed by
1. Adding Rabbit and Steel as an application by clicking the + button
2. Download the mod by clicking the ⚙+ button
3. Search "RnS Reloaded" and install it

Alternatively, it can be downloaded manually by 
1. Opening the folder where your R2Reloaded mods are usually somewhere like C:\Reloaded-II\Mods
2. Unzip the mod that is found in the releases tab and put it into that folder

This mod requires two dependencies, reloaded.sharedlib.hooks and RNSReloaded which should be installed automatically regardless of which instalation method you choose.
